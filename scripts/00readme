#### Provenance

All the scripts in this directory use:

- the issue6 branch of pyfive and
- the testing2407 branch of activestorage.

Only the following scripts have been tested since I split this
out as a standalone repo and reorganised the input files:

- bnl_overall
- bnl_overview
- bnl_timeseries_runner

Other scripts may need modification as the input data will have
moved.
